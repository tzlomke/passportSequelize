# passportSequelize

## User Authentication with Passport and Sequelize
passportSequelize is a reusable, tweakable framework for user authentication using a MySQL database, Sequelize.js, Passport.js, bCrypt.js and a few other node packages to securely handle account creation, storage and sign-ins. I made this largely for my personal use, but feel free to use it for your own projects.
